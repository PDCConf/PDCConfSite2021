      <description>1. Purpose A primary goal of GDG Toulouse is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). GDG Toulouse prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means the jerky behavior isnâ€™t allowed at GDG meetings.</description>
